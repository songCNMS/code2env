# task048_typed_fixture_helper_args - History Log

<!-- METADATA:SESSION=0 -->

## Session 0 - 2026-06-15 UTC - Task created by team lead

- Team lead `intern_code2env_lead` created this task from coordinator Session 24
  handoff after goal API timeout and peer fallback notice.
- Implementation assigned to `intern_code2env_worker_1`.
- Independent tester and real sample validation assigned to
  `intern_code2env_worker_2`.
- Artifact root prepared at
  `/home/leisong/codes/work-agents/intern_code2env_lead/outputs/session24_typed_fixture_helper_args/`.
- Preferred target is `simpa.utils.calculate:rotation`; if blocked, worker must
  provide an alternative real sample repo with at least three semantic helpers
  and an explicit SIMPA blocker.
- Acceptance requires successful helper returns, not only helper trace coverage:
  `helper_trace_complete=true`, `helper_calls_successful=true`,
  `helper_trace_valid=true`, source tool returns ok, and final answer correct
  against a real-value golden.
