# task048_typed_fixture_helper_args - History Log

<!-- METADATA:SESSION=2 -->

## Session 0 - 2026-06-15 UTC - Task created by team lead

- Team lead `intern_code2env_lead` created this task from coordinator Session 24
  handoff after goal API timeout and peer fallback notice.
- Implementation assigned to `intern_code2env_worker_1`.
- Independent tester and real sample validation assigned to
  `intern_code2env_worker_2`.
- Artifact root prepared at
  `/home/leisong/codes/work-agents/intern_code2env_lead/outputs/session24_typed_fixture_helper_args/`.
- Preferred target is `simpa.utils.calculate:rotation`; if blocked, worker must
  provide an alternative real sample repo with at least three semantic helpers
  and an explicit SIMPA blocker.
- Acceptance requires successful helper returns, not only helper trace coverage:
  `helper_trace_complete=true`, `helper_calls_successful=true`,
  `helper_trace_valid=true`, source tool returns ok, and final answer correct
  against a real-value golden.

## Session 1 - 2026-06-15 UTC - Implementation reassigned to worker_4

- Team lead checked lead mailbox and PR #34 after repeated goal continuations:
  mailbox had no ready report, and PR #34 remained at bootstrap head
  `8291cf214668fb7a103115db768e868e599aad5a`.
- PR #34 contained only worker status and task metadata files, with no product
  code, focused/full test results, rollout JSONL, summary artifacts, or ready
  report.
- Shared worker status showed `intern_code2env_worker_4` Idle, while
  `intern_code2env_worker_3` and `intern_code2env_worker_5` still reported
  Working on older tasks.
- To keep task048 moving, implementation ownership is reassigned from
  `intern_code2env_worker_1` to `intern_code2env_worker_4`; worker_2 remains the
  independent tester / validation worker.
- Worker_4 must open a fresh implementation PR or otherwise clearly report the
  exact PR/head used for validation. Worker_2 must validate only a ready exact
  implementation head with product code, tests, and artifacts.

## Session 2 - 2026-06-15 UTC - Worker_4 acceptance/progress

- `intern_code2env_worker_4` confirmed task ownership and can take over
  implementation.
- Worker_4 will use branch
  `intern_code2env_worker_4/task048_typed_fixture_helper_args` from
  `origin/main@c365a60`.
- PR #34 remains superseded and is not the validation target.
- Mailbox acceptance/progress sent to `intern_code2env_lead` with message id
  `task048-w4-acceptance-progress-20260615-001`.
- First ready checkpoint is product code with focused tests for typed
  torch/numpy fixture descriptors and trace helper argument synthesis, followed
  by full `python3 -m pytest -q` and SIMPA or documented real-sample rollout
  artifacts.
